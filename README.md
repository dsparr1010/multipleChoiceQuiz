Multiple choice quiz using Javascript

Intro :
I created a timed multiple choice quiz. The application features HTML Bootstrap, CSS, and Javascript. The application runs in the browser. Elements of the page are responsive.

Features:
Bootstrap 4 was used to create buttons and format much of the page. Upon click of "start" button, questions and answer selections appear. Utilizing JavaScript, the user is to select an answer. If answered correctly, user's score goes up by 1; if answered incorrectly, user's time is decreased by 5 seconds. Upon all questions being answered or timer reaching 0, a final score is rendered and an input box appears for user's initials. The information is then placed in localStorage to keep track of all initials and scores until storage is cleared. Audio files were added on click of a wrong or right answer and and end of quiz.
